## Common questions:

**Question:** I have a rogue fiddle in my listing that crashes the browser when loading, how can I fix this?

> **Answer:** It's possible to add `?disable_render=true` to the end of URL's where fiddles are listed - this will disable the results tab, allowing you to remove the rouge fiddle.
